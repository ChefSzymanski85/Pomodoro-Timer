# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a Pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. I created this project to help both students and workers know when it is time to take a break. Many Americans suffer from over-working themselves, and I hope that this timer will help people to have a more relaxed life.

## Features
- Set the focus duration (default to 25 minutes, no less than 5 or more than 60).
- Set the break duration (default to 5 minutes, no less than 1 or more than 15).
- When the user clicks the "play" button, the timer starts.
- When the focus time expires, an alarm plays and then the break timer starts.
- When the break time expires, the alarm plays again and then the focus timer starts.

## Technology
### Built with React and Bootstrap. Used the following React features:
- useState
- React Hooks
- Props
- Components

## Discoveries
Learned how to make a basic app using React. Became more comfortable using components and dealing with state.

## Future Goals
Would like to add a comment box so that people who use the timer can log what they accomplished during their session, and
figure out what is the appropriate break time that works for them.
